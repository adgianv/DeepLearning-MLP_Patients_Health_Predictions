# Health Prediction Project - MultiLayer Perceptron, Ensembles, SVM, KNN

## Overview and Objective

This project aims to perform two distinct classification tasks using a patient dataset: predicting the "Length of Stay" and forecasting mortality ("HOSPITAL EXPIRE FLAG").
- Description of the tasks are described in detail within the two sub-repositories.

## Libraries
**Standard DataScience Libraries, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow**

## Dataset

The dataset comprises approximately 25,000 observations related to patient admissions at the hospital. It includes standard health indicators (e.g., respiratory rate, heart rate) along with admission dates and other relevant variables. The target variables, "Length of Stay" and "HOSPITAL EXPIRE FLAG," are available in the training data for model training.
