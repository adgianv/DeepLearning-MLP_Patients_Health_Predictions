# Health Prediction project - MultiLayer Perceptron, Ensembles, SVM, KNN

## Overview and Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct two distinct classification tasks using a patients' dataset: predicting "Length of Stay" of the patient and predicting death ("HOSPITAL EXPIRE FLAG").

## Dataset

The dataset consists of around 25,000 observations that correspond to a patient's data when accessing the hospital. The data comprehends the patient's standard health levels (respiratory, heart rate, etc..), the date of access and other variables together with the target variables which are obviously available in the training data, allowing training.
